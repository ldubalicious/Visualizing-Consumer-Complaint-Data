# Visualizing-Consumer-Complaint-Data

This was a short project for a Creative Tech II module on using Javascript to access data through API's and display it on an interactive website.

The website visualizes consumer complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency created 
in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to ensure that banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat American consumers fairly.
The visual format of these charts was inspired by a data visualization of evictions over time and their causes in San Francisco by Herwig Scherabon (http://scherabon.com/filter/Data-Visualization/San-Francisco-Evictions). Using CFPB’s API, I pulled data on the last 10,000 consumer complaints and presented them first by order of complaint and then by the type of product about which the complaint was filed. The second data source I used was the New York Times article search API. The viewer can click each of the product categories on the “Complaints by Product Type” chart to display more information – including a description of the most common complaints about that product and the five latest, relevant New York Time articles.
